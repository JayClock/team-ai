=== Introduction

Team AI provides a HATEOAS-compliant REST API using HAL+JSON and HAL-FORMS media types.
This documentation is automatically generated from tests using Spring REST Docs.

==== Media Types

|===
|Media Type |Description |Use Case

|`application/hal+json`
|HAL format with `_links` for navigation
|General API consumption

|`application/prs.hal-forms+json`
|HAL-FORMS with `_templates` for actions
|AI agents, dynamic form generation
|===

==== HATEOAS-Driven Navigation

Clients should navigate the API by following links rather than constructing URLs.
All resources include `_links` with discoverable relationships.

.Entry Point Discovery
[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET https://api.team-ai.example.com/api/

==== Authentication

The API uses OAuth2 with GitHub as the identity provider.
Follow the `login` link from the root resource to authenticate.

==== HAL-FORMS Templates

Resources include `_templates` that describe available actions.
Each template specifies:

* `method` - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* `target` - Target URL (if different from self link)
* `properties` - Required input fields
* `contentType` - Expected Content-Type for request body

This is particularly useful for AI agents that need to discover API capabilities dynamically.
